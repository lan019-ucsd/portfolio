            <h2> As abortion clinics shut down, residents face increased travel requirements for care, widening disparities in access to reproductive healthcare across the U.S.</h2>

            <h3> Clinic Closures Increase Travel and Access Inequality</h3>

                <figcaption> This choropleth map displays geographic inequalities in access. The relative percentages of U.S residents within each state who 
                    traveled out-of-state for abortion care and healthcare services in 2020. Such values are standardized with Z-Scores to effectively compare 
                    relative to the national average. As shown, darker hues indicate higher levels of travel, highlighing states where significant clinic closures 
                    could impose greater barriers to local abortion access.

                    <b> Z-Score Standardization (Score: 2): </b>
                        Transformed raw travel percentages into z-scores to standardize how each state differs from national average, 
                        allowing for apparent and comparible patterns across regions. This transformation accounts for variability 
                        and remains earnest given its strengthening influence on the map's analytical integrity.

                    <b> Binned Color Categories (Score: 1):</b>
                        I created travel categories based on standard deviation thresholds to facilitate readability from a non-statistical audience.
                        This binning transforms continuous z-scores into discrete levels to quickly identify varying access inequalities.

                <li> 
                    <b> Continuous Color Scale (Score:0.5): </b>
                        This color scale enforces the emotional weight of inequality. Darker hues signal greater barriers to abortion access as 
                        more residents must travel out-of-state for abortion care. This color choice is intentionally persuasive as the color 
                        intensity can correspond to severity.

                    <b> Title/Subtitle (Score 2): </b>
                        The title neutrally retains factual accuracy in detailing the inequality of reproductive access states in 2020. The subtitle also includes general 
                        date transformations and a simple explanation of color hues (z-score) to guide the viewer's interpretation toward the 
                        proposition's stance.

                    <b> Legend(Score 1):</b>
                        We use the the Z-score with additional descriptive terms to allow readability in both statistical and plain language and allow the map to be
                        intuitively and emotionally resonant.

            <h3> Regions with Major Clinic Losses Correspond to Decreasing Abortion Rates</h3>

                <img src="../images/argument1.jpg" alt="Graph opposing the proposition">
                <figcaption> This bar chart displays the average percentage change in clinic availability and abortion rates across the four main regions 
                    (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) between 2017 and 2020. State-level data were grouped by reigion and averaged to illuminate broad 
                    regional disparities. Blue bars represent clinic changes (%), while red bars represent corresponding changes in abortion rates (%).

                <li> 
                    <b>Regional Data Aggregation (Score: 2) </b>
                    I grouped all states into the main four U.S Cenus regions. Then, I computed the mean
                    percentage change for abortion rates and clinic numbers to simplify state-level variation 
                    into smaller, more easily-interpretable categories. This decision reduces noise from regional 
                    disparities and preserves earnest directional trends for regional disparities.

                    <b> Category Color Encoding (Score: 1) </b>
                    I used a conventional and intuitive color scheme to distinguish between clinic access (blue) and abortion rate (red).
                    Although the color contrast may heighten emotional impact, this decision directly represents two distinct categories.

                    <b> Bar Annotation (Score: 2) </b>
                    Each bar is annotated with its corresponding percentage change to ensure accessible numerical precision and reduce potential
                    misinterpretation. In other words, this enhancees transparancy as it emphasizes quantitative support.

                    <b> Title/Subtitle (Score: 1) </b>
                    The title conveys the main argument and what the visualization shows, though the framing is somewhat persuasiave as it guides 
                    interpretation towards the decline of abortion rates. The subtitle properly outlines and clarifies data transformations.
