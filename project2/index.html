            <h3> Clinic Closures Increase Travel and Access Inequality</h3>

                <figcaption> This choropleth map displays geographic inequalities in access. The relative percentages of U.S residents within each state who 
                    traveled out-of-state for abortion care and healthcare services in 2020. Such values are standardized with Z-Scores to effectively compare 
                    relative to the national average. As shown, darker hues indicate higher levels of travel, highlighing states where significant clinic closures 
                    could impose greater barriers to local abortion access.
